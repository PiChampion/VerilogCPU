# VerilogCPU

This project was completed during the ECE 310 course at NC State. The project involved implementing a simple CPU from scratch using Verilog. Characteristics of the CPU include separate control and data path with multiple modules, utilizing a pipelined multiplier to handle multiplication opcodes, and a synchronous reset. Assumptions made to simplify design include there being no off-chip memory, the program consists of valid instructions only, and no overflow detection is required.
